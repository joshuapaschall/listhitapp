# Legacy SQL

This directory stores the original migrations and bootstrap SQL files for historical reference. They are **not** used by the current Supabase bootstrap flow. Use the consolidated files in `scripts/db` to provision new environments; these legacy files exist only to track prior change history and should not be applied to fresh databases.
